- Implemented `src/router/` — path resolution, atomic writes, asset copying
- Added `required_capabilities` field to SkillModel and skill.yaml parsing
- `TargetScope` made `pub` for cross-module access
- No structural API contract deviations from Phase 2 TechSpec

### v0.2.0 — 2026-06-17 — Epic A Implementation
